# Progressive Web App

## Description
  
With this assignment we were tasked to finish the started code given to us to create a progressive web app.  We had to update the webpack.config file to insert all the plugins and modules needed for this to work.  We inserted the following plugins: HtmlWebpackPlugin, WebpackPwaManifest and InjectManifest.  We also had to modify a few files to get the cacheing and Indexdb working.
